# Conet PHP Mini Framework
A Mini PHP Framework for developers
With Conet you can develop your web app such as static websites, blogging, and some web medium projects. <br><br>
Conet is very easy to use. It has about a hundred inbuilt functions which can be called in any of your files.<br><br>
We have created well explained <a href="http://conet.m3tech.com.ng" target="_blank">Documentation</a> for this mini framework to guide the developers how to use it without having issues.
We have also created a community where issues, suggestions, corrections, problems and more can be discussed.<br><br>

<h3>Contributions</h3>
<p>
This mini framework is created with love. Purpose of building it was to help the upcoming developers in 
developing their skills and make things easy for them. One major purpose is to create a small framework that won't have or depend on any dependencies.
This is the reason Conet is very fast and efficient.

<p>
Though this mini framework was writing in procedural PHP, contributions are expected from PHP developers all over the world. From you, some 
intelligent features can still be added to the this mini framework. We are expecting from you guys soon. Thanks.

<h3>Mission and Vision</h3>
<p>
It is obvious that Conet version 3.0 was writing in procedural PHP. This version will be maintained to version 3.9 in procedural PHP and some features 
and functions will be added concurrently. It is in promise that Conet 4.0 will be writing in OOP PHP with full features of frameworks. Then Conet will 
not be mini framework, it will be a full framework like the others.
